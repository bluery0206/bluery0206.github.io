# WebDev Project: "My Personal Website" to be submitted to: Ins. Alvin Remolado
#
# The creation of this project has been fun despite the lack of laptop as for it is still on repair.  
# 
# I did some coding and editing on a computer shop but it was rather cosyly and so I built most of the project on my phone. 
#
# The process was painstakingly slow compared to using a computer but I still enjoyed, recovered a lot of forgotten knowledge I had since I have not been able to code this much again before and learn new things such as how to use Github and the importance of the viewport meta tag for making responsive webpages. 
#
# Software/Apps used:
#     - Trebedit from Google Playstore
#     - VS Code for coding software
#     - Github for online storage (though it was unnecessary)
